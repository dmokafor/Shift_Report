# Shift Report
## Project Overview
Operational inefficiencies arise from delayed insights, fragmented communication, and a lack of real-time visibility, leading to reactive issue resolution, poor shift handovers, low accountability, and poor coordination accross teams resulting in operational efficiencies, higher costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.

This dashboard aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive summary of Shift Performance for operations and non-operations users (e.g. middle management).
