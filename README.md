# Shift Report
## Project Overview
Enhanced Version:
This dashboard delivers a comprehensive summary of on-going Shift Performance tailored for both operations teams and non-operations stakeholders (i.e middle management). It is designed to:
- Enhance situational awareness across teams
- Enable data-driven, proactive decision-making
- Strengthen accountability and ownership
- Streamline cross-functional coordination
- Facilitate efficient and effective shift handover
- Optimize service delivery performance

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard provides a structured view of shift performance, beginning with the **current shift details** and the **responsible personnel**.  

Following this, **four visual cards** highlight critical operational areas—**vessel, barge, gate, and rail**—displaying container moves and the number of carriers handled.

Beneath these, **mini cards display essential KPIs**, including:  
- **Safety incidents**  
- **Port hours saved**  
- **CMPH (Containers Moved Per Hour)**  
- **Truck turn time**  
- **Yard utilization**  

The **bar chart** illustrates overall **Shift Performance**, measured from the **last container lift of the previous shift** to the **first container lift of the current shift**.  

Next, a **Container Handling Equipment (CHE) Performance table** presents insights by equipment type (MHC, RTG, TT, RS, EH), detailing:  
- Moves per hour  
- Availability  
- Utilization  

The **Vessel Performance table** provides details on **active and departed vessels during the shift**, tracking key metrics such as:  
- Total moves  
- Shift moves  
- Balance moves  
- Estimated time of completion (ETC)  
- Estimated and required time of departure  
- Estimated port hours saved  

The **Crane Performance table** captures shift-specific crane operations, including:  
- Total moves  
- Shift moves  
- Balance moves  
- First and last lift  
- Crane hours  
- Shift CMPH  
- ETC  

Additional KPIs displayed include:  
- **Truck service time**  
- **Percentage of trucks serviced for more than 90 minutes**  
- **Open terminal delivery orders**  
- **Number of containers examined by customs**  

This structured layout ensures comprehensive visibility into shift efficiency, operational bottlenecks, and overall terminal performance.
